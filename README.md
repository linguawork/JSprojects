### JS projects

Every branch  of the repo used to have a separate small JS project. 
When I had 4 projects I decided to merge them into master and keep them separately in folders.
Each one is a result of practice. I analyzed code, included comments.



## Previous branch separation
These are branch names and projects saved in them previously:
master: todo list with local storage
with-no-local-storage: just a todo list, short version
calculator: simple calculator realized
weather-app: weather-app with weather data API

Later I just merged them all into the master.
